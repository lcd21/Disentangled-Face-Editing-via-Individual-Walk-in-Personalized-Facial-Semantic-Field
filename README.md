# Disentangled-Face-Editing-via-Individual-Walk-in-Personalized-Facial-Semantic-Field
This project demonstrates the examples of disentangled face editing by our method. More experiment results will be public.
We conduct our experiments on the face datasets FFHQ and CelebaHQ. The homepage of FFHQ is at https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan and the dataset can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u2xu7bSrWxrbUxk-dT-UvEJq8IjdmNTP. The homepage of CelebaHQ is at [https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans) and the dataset can be downloaded at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u2xu7bSrWxrbUxk-dT-UvEJq8IjdmNTP](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4qLcYyJmiz0TXY1NG02bzZVRGs?resourcekey=0-arAVTUfW9KRhN-irJchVKQ).

Only the single target attribute (e.g., eyeglasses, gender, expression, or mustache) is edited with the others unchanged. The background and identity are preserved during editing. All results are with high resolution 1024*1024.
