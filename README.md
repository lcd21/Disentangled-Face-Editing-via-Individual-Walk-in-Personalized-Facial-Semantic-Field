# Disentangled-Face-Editing-via-Individual-Walk-in-Personalized-Facial-Semantic-Field
This project demonstrates the examples of disentangled face editing by our method.

Only the single target attribute (e.g., eyeglasses, male, smile, and age) is edited with the others unchanged and all results are with high resolution 1024*1024.
